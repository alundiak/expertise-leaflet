Frontend Expertize Leaflet as CSS Grid using GitHub API


# Idea

Take a list of frontend libraries, frameworks, tools from GitHub API using GraphQL and show on page in iOS-apps-screen-like way.

List represent company expertize in frontend development.

Also section about "wannabe".

Printed out as leaflet A5 format. Preliminary in 3-fold-brochure way.

Download pdf, jpg or svg. Need to think. Ideally would be great to have proper page layout for proper print.
